# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first   
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make  
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to   
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your    
# domain name.
